    <description>Designed to match report id&apos;s to campaign id&apos;s. Used by apex report notification classes or scheduleable apex to automate adding contacts or leads from a report to a campaign when the report runs. The &apos;Name&apos; of each custom setting record must be the 15 character ID of the saved report that includes the contact or lead record ids to add as campaign members. The apex code looks up this campaign ID cross-reference based on the report it is subscribed to.</description>
